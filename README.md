# Ready-Games
During the HD Games and HER DAO hackathon, I took on the beta testing challenges presented by Ready Games. The focus of the challenge was to create user accounts and provide the necessary account details. Additionally, I worked on integrating the SDK with Ready Profile to enable wallet connectivity and token-earning functionality through gameplay. Throughout the process, one of the key hurdles I faced was generating the SHA certificate fingerprints in Unity. However, I successfully overcame this obstacle and made significant progress toward fulfilling the objectives of the project.
